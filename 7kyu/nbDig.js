// You are given a number "n" (n >= 0) and a digit "d" (0 <= d <= 9).

// Write a function nbDig(n, d) that finds the square of each integer from 0 to n, and returns the number of times that the digit d appears across all the squares. Note that d might appear multiple times in a single square.

// Example:

// n=12, d=1
// Squares from 0 to n=12: 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144
// The function returns 7 because the digit d=1 appears 7 times: in 1, 16, 81, 100, 121 (note: 1 appears twice in 121), and 144.

// n=10, d=0
// Squares from 0 to n=10: 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100
// The function returns 3 because the digit d=0 appears 3 times: in 0 and 100 (note: 0 appears twice in 100).

//concated every powered number and just count how many occurrences of the digit in the final string
function nbDig(n, d){
    result = '';
    for (let i = 0; i <= n; i++){
        result += Math.pow(i, 2);
    }
    return result.split(d).length-1
}
